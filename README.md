# lead_risk_nyc


Exposure to lead poses a significant danger to public health.  Young children are most vulnerable to the detrimental effects of lead poisoning:  elevated blood lead levels (BLL) in this population are associated with early neurological development issues, neuropsychiatric disorders, lowered IQs, and in extreme cases, death.  Significant effort has been dedicated to the elimination of lead exposure over the last decades, and while cases of lead poisoning continue to decline the problem is far from being eradicated.  Local authorities across the United States struggle to dedicate resources for risk evaluation, preventative measures, as well as remediation in cases where lead is found.  In order to optimize the limited budgets of local departments of health, it is crucial to identify neighborhoods most at risk and to target families within these areas for testing, preventative education and intervention.  This project focuses on NYC.

The goal of lead_risk_nyc is to rank NYC neighborhoods by number of projected lead poisoning cases in order to target intervention resources.  It runs in ipython notebook.

Raw and pre-processed data files can be found in respective subfolders.  Some cleaning of data was performed in SQL.
